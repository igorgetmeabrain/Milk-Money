# What is Moola!?

Moola monitors communal milk usage in a typical workplace. Massively over-engineered, with a plethora of unnecessary features and gimmicks, it nevertheless should serve its primary purpose, which is to calculate whose turn it is to replenish the communal milk supply!

## How does Moola work?

Milk usage is calculated in Moonits.
One Moonit is 25ml of milk, about the amount required for a single hot beverage.
(Those who prefer it milkier may use two or more Moonits per drink).

Every time you dip into the communal milk supply, you log it on Moola and your Moonit balance will be updated accordingly.

When milk supplies dwindle, you may replenish the supply and log it on Moola to top up your Moonit balance.

Alternatively, you may consult the Moonit leaderboard, or ask Moozart the cow whose turn it is to buy the milk! 

## What else can I do on Moola?

There are quite a few interactive features, so try clicking around and see what happens!
There is even a Daily Quiz, to ponder whilst you sup your favourite beverage!
